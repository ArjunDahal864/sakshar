# Sakshar

Sakshar is an application that helps students of Nepal, exchange notes, assignments, and study materials. Besides, one can also ask a question and other users and answer or provide the resources needed for him/her.

## Things to address

0. This is a completely community-driven project. We all have equal ownership of this project.
1. The process we will be following will be the same in any kind of software company.
2. We never choose programming languages and decide on tech stack at first.
3. We won't move forward unless we have clearly decided features and created a requirements file.
4. We will learn a lot of stuff from this project compared to any college project.
Steps that I am trying to follow to build this project.
##
Step 1: We will do some soft documentation like describing the software and defining the functionality that we will be building.

Step 2: Any ui ux developer can create designs and push such design files in the repository. (Mobile Web desktop anything you like)

Step 3: Create a poll to know available resources we have in this group (vote own skills)
Step 4: Decide tech stack.

Step 5: Create milestones and create issues to reach each milestone. 

Step 6: Setup Ci and focus and automation on code for increasing code quality.

Step 7: Search for donation and funding(it is essential to survive as an opensource project)

Step 8: Market project and get more people involved 

Step 9: Convert contributors to full-time developers. 
Step 10: Add more features and learn more.

We may or may not reach the goal nothing is certain but we can give it a shot. Doing something is better than nothing. 
We are doing these things so that we all can learn stuff and have proper skills developed so we will be different from others.
